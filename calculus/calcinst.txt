Welcome to the Calculus Calculator. In this, you can numerically calculate three values: limits, derivatives, and definite integrals.
Everything is rounded to the nearest thousandth place.
When entering the function, note the following:
  You must enter the function in terms of x.
  Know the order of operations when combining multiple mathematical operations. To make sure, you can always use parentheses.
  The number pi can be represented as "pi" (this HAS to be lowercase).
  The number e is simply represented as "e".
  Operations are as follows (note that num1 and num2 are placeholders):
    Addition: num1+num2
    Subtraction: num1-num2
    Multiplication: num1*num2
    Division: num1/num2
    Exponent (num1 to the power of num2): num1**num2
    Square Root: sqrt(num1)
    Natural Log: ln(num1)
    Common Logarithm (Base 10): log(num1,10)
    General Logarithms: log(num1,base)
    Sine (radians): sin(num1)
    Cosine (radians): cos(num1)
    Tangent (radians): tan(num1)
    Inverse Sine (radians): asin(num1)
    Inverse Cosine (radians): acos(num1)
    Inverse Tangent (radians): atan(num1)
